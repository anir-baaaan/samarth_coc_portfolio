# Portfolio Website
A portfolio sample made for Samarth's Clash of Creativity competition.

## About this project
I took this oppurtunity to experiment a bit. I have been meaning to try and emulate an operating system or a terminal as a website for a while now. Having seen several mind-blowing showcases on YouTube, Reddit and GitHub. I decided to dip my toes in the hype a little bit too.

## Inspirations
Seeing so many such projects readily available on GitHub gave me hope that there is a possiblity I can acheive this. Some examples include
* [vivek9patel's Portfolio](https://github.com/vivek9patel/vivek9patel.github.io)
* [mukundsolanki's Portfolio](https://github.com/mukundsolanki/terminal-portfolio)
* [Akhlak-Hossain-Jim Portfolio](https://github.com/Akhlak-Hossain-Jim/ubuntu-ui-portfolio)
* [anicolas91's Portfolio](https://github.com/anicolas91/portfolio-ubuntu-site)
* [dev-madhurendra's Portfolio](https://github.com/dev-madhurendra/terminal-portfolio)
* [codewithnakul's MAC OS Showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jHLQuSltgU)

So after taking inspirations from these, following a lot of tutorials and borrowing code from several repositories. I finally made something.
